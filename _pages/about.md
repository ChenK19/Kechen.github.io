# Ke Chen - Neuroscience researcher

## About Me
I am a neuroscientist focusing on iEEG-based research. My work spans multiple domains including neural signal processing like anesthesia and brain decoding. My research primarily revolves around understanding neural dynamics during anesthesia and applying advanced decoding techniques to uncover meaningful insights from invasive brain signals.


## ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- **Anesthesia & Neural Dynamics**: Investigating how neural signals change during different states of consciousness, especially between subcortical and cortical areas.
- **Neural Decoding**: Developing methods to decode neural signals corresponding to multimodal stimuli recorded from deep brain electrodes.

## ðŸŒ± Interests
- Computational neuroscience
- Brain decoding
